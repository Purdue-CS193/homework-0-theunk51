# Amyah's First CS193 Homework

**Some of My Favorite Things About CS193**
- I am officially (well as officially as it'll get in this lifetime) Git and the Terminal.
	- As self taught programmer, very few things have been formally taught to me, and I fear that there are things and concepts that I have misunderstood or have been misinformed. Everything I know about Git and the Terminal is learnt 'as needed'. This class makes sure that I know the basics for what I will need to know in the professional world.
- NO EXAMS :tada:
