# Amyah's First CS193 Homework

**Some of My Favorite Things About CS193**
- I am officially (well as officially as it'll get in this lifetime) Git and the Terminal.
	As a self-taught programmer, I have been taught very few things formally, and I fear that I have misunderstood or been misinformed about some concepts. Everything I know about Git and the Terminal is learned 'as needed'. This class ensures that I know the basics of what I will need to know in the professional world.
- NO EXAMS :tada:
